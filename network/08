#I Googled "find the provider of a website", clicked the first link (hostingchecker.com), and entered "slash16.org". It returned the following information:
#
#Datacenter: Amazon.com
#Server IP: 52.84.31.112
#City: Seattle 52.84.31.112
#Location: United States of America

#Another way to do it would be to:
#ping slash16.org
#and then use that IP address to:
whois 52.84.245.152
